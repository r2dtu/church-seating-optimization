# Church Seating Optimization Program

### Overview
This program finds an "optimal" seating arrangement for a given available pew seating capacity on a first-come-first-serve basis (order of reservation).
When the Submit button is clicked, on success, a CSV file will be downloaded with each family/group's information and their seat assignments.

It was initially designed for the Newman Center Catholic Community at UCSD parish to assist in the re-opening process, after having closed the church as a result of the CoVid-19 pandemic.
